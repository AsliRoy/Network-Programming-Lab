1. Printing your machine’s name and IPv4 address ? 

2. Retrieve  a remote machine’s IP address and  convert the  IP address  to different format?

3. Setting  and  getting  the  default socket  timeout,  the  program  should include how to handle the socket error gracefully?

4. Finding the service name, given the port and protocol of the remote host (server)?

5. Printing the current time from the internet time server with the help of  NTP? Also  write  an  SNTP  client  that  prints  the current  time  from  the internet time server received with the SNTP protocol? 

6. Modifying  sockets  send/receive  buffer  size  and  changing  the  socket  to blocking/non-blocking mode?

7. Write a program that demonstrates the reuse socket addresses?

8. Write  a  simple  TCP  echo  client/server  application  with  the  help  of TCP socket  object.  The  server  wait  for  the client  to be  connected  and  send some data to the server. When the data is received, the server echoes the data to the client.

9. Write  a  simple  UDP  echo  client/server  application  with  the  help  of  TCP socket  object.  The  server  wait  for  the client  to be  connected  and  send some data to the server. When the data is received, the server echoes the data to the client.

10. Write  a  program  that  is  a  TCP  server  that  returns  a  HTTP  response  to  a browser that displays the client’s IP address and the number of times it  has  connected  to  the  server.    Test  your  program  with  a  standard  Web browser like the Internet Explorer.
